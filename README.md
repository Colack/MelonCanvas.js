# 🍉 MelonCanvas.js

## Empowering Game Development with Simplicity and Fun! 🎮

MelonCanvas.js is a lightweight, fast, and flexible JavaScript framework designed to make canvas-based game development a breeze. Whether you're a beginner looking to quickly prototype an idea or an experienced developer aiming to build more advanced 2D games, MelonCanvas.js is here to help you focus on what really matters — your game mechanics and creativity.

By simplifying common tasks like physics, collision detection, asset management, and event handling, this framework allows you to get started quickly without sacrificing the features you need to build complex and polished games.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🌟 Lightweight & Fast
MelonCanvas.js is designed to be simple and efficient. It’s quick to set up, runs smoothly, and comes with all the core features you need to create 2D games without unnecessary bloat.

### 🖼 Canvas Rendering
Utilizes the HTML5 canvas API for rendering, making it perfect for 2D games, animations, interactive graphics, and visualizations. Easily create games with beautiful, pixel-perfect rendering.

### 🏗 Modular Game Objects
The engine supports layers, custom events, collisions, and physics, allowing you to organize and structure game objects in a flexible and scalable way. Add, remove, and update objects with ease.

### 🎥 Camera System
With the built-in camera system, you can easily implement panning, zooming, and target-following, giving you full control over the game view. Perfect for platformers, top-down games, and more!

### 🎮 Asset Management
Simplified asset loading and management for images, audio, and tilesets. Automatically handle assets and load them asynchronously, so you can keep your game running smoothly.

### ⚖ Physics
Support for gravity, velocity, and bounce to add realism and dynamic interactions to your game. Perfect for platformers, physics-based puzzles, or any game that requires object movement and interaction.

### 🛡 Collision Detection
Effortlessly detect collisions between game objects with support for axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABB). Objects can react to collisions in a variety of ways, including bouncing and position correction.

### 🔔 Event System
Global and object-specific event handling lets you respond to user inputs, timed events, and object interactions. Define custom events for your game objects and make your game world come to life.

### 🏙 Tilemap Support
Easily create tile-based maps using external tilesets. This feature makes it simple to build platformers, top-down adventure games, or any other grid-based game world.
